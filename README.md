# Computer Graphics 1 - Exercises

This repository contains fundamental exercises and implementation of Meshes, Smoothing, Stripification of 3D Meshes.
It contains the source code and data sets for the CG1 exercises. To download and compile the project, you need to do the following steps:

1. Clone the project to your local computer
2. Run CMake to generate a project file for your build platform. Alternatively, you can use a development environment that supports CMake natively and open the directory directly.
3. Open the project file and compile.

Under Unix, you could employ the command line like follows:

    git clone https://github.com/Saraavana/Computer-Graphics-1.git --recursive
	cd cg1
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

After this, you find the compiled applications under `cg1/build/bin`.
	
On Windows / Visual Studio, you can use the CMake GUI. After cloning the repository, open the CMake GUI and set *Where is the source code* to the cloned directory. Set *Where to build the binaries* to a new subfolder `build`. Click *Configure* and select the desired Visual Studio Version. Then, click *Configure*  and *Open Project* to generate and open the project in Visual studio. Finally, choose the desired startup project (Exercise1-4) and compile and run.
